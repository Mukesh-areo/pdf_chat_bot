      "Body: Trilogy Metals Announces Positive Study Results for the Bornite Copper Project Located in Alaska, USA\n",
      "Body: VANCOUVER, BC, Jan. 15, 2025 /CNW/ - Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX: TMQ) (NYSE American: TMQ) (\"Trilogy Metals\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the positive results of its Preliminary Economic Assessment Study (\"Bornite PEA\") for the Bornite copper project in the Ambler Mining District of Northwestern Alaska (the \"Bornite Project\"). The Bornite Project is held by Ambler Metals LLC (\"Ambler Metals\"), the joint venture operating company equally owned by Trilogy Metals and South32 Limited (\"South32\"). The Bornite PEA was prepared on a 100% ownership basis, of which Trilogy Metals' share is 50%. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\n",
      "Body: Trilogy Metals will host a conference call on January 15, 2025 at 1:00pm Pacific Time or 4:00pm Eastern Time to discuss these results.\n",
      "Body: Please use this link to access the live webcast of the conference call:\n",
      "https://www.c-meeting.com/web3/joinTo/38ZLQJQ93P2A84/ZgO5Nop1EQzwZllpJru9iA\n",

      "Canada/USA Toll Free: 1-844-763-8274 or International Toll: +1-647-484-8814\n",
      "Body: Highlights of the Bornite PEA\n",
      "Body: The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.\n",
      "Body: The Bornite PEA describes the technical and economic viability of establishing an underground mining operation for a 6,000 tonne-per-day operation with a 17-year mine life. The PEA assumes re-purposing the infrastructure described in the Company's current Feasibility Study for the Arctic Project for use with the Bornite Project once the Arctic deposit has been depleted. The Feasibility Study for the Arctic Project can be accessed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar. The base case scenario for the Bornite PEA utilizes a long-term metal price of $4.20/lb for copper.\n",
      "Body: Tony Giardini, President and Chief Executive Officer of Trilogy Metals commented, \"Although we believe that further exploration along the 100km volcanogenic massive sulphide belt will extend the mine life of the Arctic Project beyond the 13 years established by the current Arctic Feasibility Study, the Bornite PEA study shows it is possible, with existing known resources, to continue mine activity at the UKMP beyond 30 years.\"\n",
      "Body: The salient details of the Bornite PEA are displayed in the tables below.\n",
      "Body: Table 1. Metal Production and Assumed Metal Prices\n",
      "Body: Table 2. Operating and Capital Costs\n",
      "Body: Table 3. Financial Results\n",
      "Body: Table 4. Mineral Resources for the Bornite Deposit\n",
      "Body: The South Reef includes a relatively high-grade mineralized zone that would be amendable to underground mining methods should a decision be made not to mine the mineral resources by open pit methods. Table 5 illustrates the portions of the South Reef at a higher cut-off grade (sensitivity to cut-off grade), representing an opportunity that could be considered for mining of this material using only underground mining methods which is illustrated in the PEA.\n",
      "Body: Table 5. Portions of South Reef Mineral Resource Amenable to Underground Mining\n",
      "Body: Table 6. Subset of the Mineral Resources Included in the Underground LOM Plan\n",
      "Body: Trilogy Metals engaged independent consultants, Wood Canada Limited (\"Wood\"), Ausenco Engineering Canada ULC (\"Ausenco\"), SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (\"SRK\"), International Metallurgical & Environmental Inc. (\"Int Met\"), and Core Geoscience LLC (\"Core\") to prepare the Bornite PEA on a 100% ownership basis, under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). The full technical report will be available under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca within 45 days of this news release.  An Initial Assessment for the Bornite Project was also prepared on a 100% ownership basis in accordance with Subpart 1300 and Item 601 of the Regulation S-K and the full technical report summary will be available under the Company's profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar when published.\n",
      "Body: The Bornite PEA forecasts total payable production to be 1.9 billion pounds of copper over a 17-year mine life.  More importantly, the Bornite PEA demonstrates the ability to extend mine activity at the UKMP to over 30 years. The Bornite PEA does not incorporate any closure cost synergies for the Arctic Project which may be significant.\n",
      "Body: The Bornite PEA is based on a 6,000 tonne-per-day underground mining operation with conventional milling and flotation process that results in the production of copper concentrate.  Based on the Bornite PEA level metallurgical work on the sulphide mineralization, the average recoveries are projected to be 90.9% for copper, producing a copper concentrate grade average of 29.5% over the life-of-mine.\n",
      "Body: Initial capital expenditure is $503.8 million and sustaining capital is $363.1 million for total estimated capital expenditures of $866.9 million. This includes the retrofit costs for re-purposing the Arctic mill for Bornite purposes.  In addition, closure and reclamation costs are estimated at $81.2 million.\n",
      "Body: There has been no material change to the mineral resource estimates for the Bornite Project as reported in the Company's previous technical reports entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Mineral Resource Update of the Bornite Project, Northwest, Alaska, USA\" with an effective date of January 26, 2023 and \"Technical Report Summary on the Initial Assessment of the Bornite Mineral Resource, Northwest Alaska, USA\" dated November 30, 2022. The Company's current mineral reserve and mineral resources tables can be found on the Company's website.\n",

      "Body: The Bornite PEA was prepared by the contributors listed below, each of whom is a Qualified Person under NI 43-101.\n",
      "Body: Data Verification\n",
      "Body: Messrs. Kim and Boese have visited the site of the Bornite Project. The Bornite PEA Contributors have had discussions with relevant site personnel and Company management and have reviewed supporting documentation including initial source documents. Additional information on data verification can be found in the Bornite technical report which will be available under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca within 45 days of this news release.\n",
      "Body: Qualified Persons\n",
      "Body: The Bornite PEA contributors prepared or supervised the preparation of the information that forms the basis of the Bornite PEA disclosure in this news release and have approved its dissemination.\n",
      "Body: Richard Gosse, P.Geo., Vice President, Exploration for Trilogy Metals, is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Gosse has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information in this news release.\n",
      "Body: Conference Call\n",
      "Body: The conference call to discuss results of the Bornite PEA will be held on January 15, 2025 at 1:00pm Pacific Time or 4:00pm Eastern Time.\n",

      "Body: About Trilogy Metals\n",
      "Body: Trilogy Metals Inc. is a metal exploration and development company which holds a 50 percent interest in Ambler Metals LLC, which has a 100 percent interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwestern Alaska. On December 19, 2019, South32, a globally diversified mining and metals company, exercised its option to form a 50/50 joint venture with Trilogy Metals. The UKMP is located within the Ambler Mining District which is one of the richest and most-prospective known copper-dominant districts in the world. It hosts world-class polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (\"VMS\") deposits that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits which have been found to host high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization. Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler Mining District - the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within a land package that spans approximately 190,929 hectares. Ambler Metals has an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., an Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for the exploration and potential development of the Ambler Mining District in cooperation with local communities. Trilogy Metals' vision is to develop the Ambler Mining District into a premier North American copper producer while protecting and respecting subsistence livelihoods.\n",

      "Body: Cautionary Note to United States Investors\n",
      "Body: This news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Unless otherwise indicated, all resource and reserve estimates included or referenced in this news release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (\"CIM Definition Standards\"). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, may differ from the requirements of the SEC, and resource and reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term \"resource\" does not equate to the term \"reserves\". Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of \"measured\" or \"indicated resources\" will ever be converted into \"reserves\". Investors should also understand that \"inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Under Canadian rules, estimated \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth or referenced herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\n",
